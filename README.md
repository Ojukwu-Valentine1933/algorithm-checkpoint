# Algorithm Description

This algorithm reads a sentence character by character and determines the following:
- The length of the sentence (number of characters).
- The number of words in the sentence (assuming words are separated by a single space).
- The number of vowels in the sentence.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have the necessary environment to run JavaScript algorithms.
2. Open the `index.algo` file in your text editor or IDE.
3. Run the algorithm using your preferred JavaScript environment.

## Example

Input: "This is a sample sentence."
Output:
- Length of sentence: 25
- Number of words: 5
- Number of vowels: 8
